# codingLncRNA: A Comprehensive Package for LncRNA Data Management

`codingLncRNA` is a utility package available both in R and Python, designed to facilitate easy management and retrieval of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) data, including RNA sequences, peptide sequences, and ORF sequences.

- [Python Package Usage](#python-package-usage)

## R Package Usage

### Installation

To install the `codingLncRNA` R package, make sure you have the `devtools` package installed and loaded in your R session. You can install it using:

```r
install.packages("devtools")
```

Then, install `codingLncRNA` from GitHub with:

```r
devtools::install_github("your_username/codingLncRNA")
```

Make sure to replace "your_username" with your actual GitHub username.

### Usage

#### Creating LncRNAData Object

First, we will utilize the `LncRNAData` function to create an object of `LncRNAData`, which incorporates the sample data included in the package.

```r
library(codingLncRNA)
lncRNAData <- LncRNAData()
```

#### Retrieving RNA, Peptide, and ORF Sequences

The `codingLncRNA` package offers several methods that allow the user to access and retrieve RNA, peptide, and ORF sequences:

```r
lncRNAData <- getRNA(lncRNAData)
lncRNAData <- getPeptide(lncRNAData)
lncRNAData <- getORF(lncRNAData)
```

Each method retrieves the corresponding sequences and stores them as a dataframe in the respective slot of the `LncRNAData` object. For instance, to view the retrieved RNA sequences, you can utilize the following command:

```r
head(lncRNAData@rna)
```

#### Obtaining Test Data

To obtain the test data that is incorporated in the `codingLncRNA` package, you can use the `getTestData` function:

```r
testData <- getTestData(lncRNAData)
```

This will return a dataframe containing the test data.

## Python Package Usage

### Installation

To install the `codingLncRNA` Python package, you can use `pip` to install directly from GitHub:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/your_username/codingLncRNA.git
```

### Usage

1. **Loading Data:**

```python
from codingLncRNA import LncRNAData, load_data

# Load data
lncRNAData = LncRNAData()
```

2. **Retrieving Sequences:**

```python
# Get RNA sequences
rna_sequences = lncRNAData.getRNA()

# Get Peptide sequences
peptide_sequences = lncRNAData.getPeptide()

# Get ORF sequences
orf_sequences = lncRNAData.getORF()
```
